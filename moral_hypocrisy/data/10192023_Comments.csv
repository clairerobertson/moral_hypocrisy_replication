Player4-Republican,3,3,1,10,It would have to be a big coincidence if the assignments were done blindly. Uses should be able to choose which one they are more comfortable doing and not be assigned something obviously more challenging.,"If people would accept possibly being given the harder assignment simply by chance, and also that the person making the decisions was from a specific political leaning.",1,NA,2,"I think it was chosen beforehand that a Republican would be giving out assignments to other Republicans, and vice versa.",The green task set was much more appealing.,OK -- no issues," *** Player1-Democrat has joined the chat ***

Player1-Democrat,2,2,6,9,"I think the procedure for selection might be blind, but the results are imbalanced since one task is 20 minutes of heavy mental exertion while another task is only 8 minutes of simple survey and photo hunting.  It would be better if it were blind and the tasks were more reasonably balanced as far as effort/time goes.","To understand how participants feel about the fairness of task assignments and payouts, and perhaps whether or not ""random"" allocation of those tasks influences the participants' perception of fairness.",1,NA,2,"Because it didn't say which participant (of my group) assigned the task, so the ""results"" could have been entirely fabricated and there was zero accountability. I basically just had to trust what was showing up on the screen. I would have much rather had us select tasks in a live chat, that way it would be in front of me rather than ""behind closed doors"" when I advance my study page.",This was really fun and unique!!!
