<br>Player1-Overestimator: I thought it'd be easier to estimate the dots. I literally only had time to count the big ones that stood out

<br>Player3-Overestimator: I thought I was going to be under to be honest
<br>Player4-Underestimator: It was fast guess.
<br>Player3-Overestimator: what did you guys guess
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I thought so too. I definitely typed in a number that was 10-20 less than I originally estimated
