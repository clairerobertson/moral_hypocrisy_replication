<br>Player4-Underestimator: rend to count the big dots first
<br>Player2-Underestimator: yeah i agree
<br>Player4-Underestimator: so  no time to count others lol
<br>Player2-Underestimator: also i dont usually get an idea of how many small dots there can be
<br>Player4-Underestimator: it is more difficult than counting the all-small-dots pictures
<br>Player2-Underestimator: definitely
<br>Player2-Underestimator: having the varying dot sizes definitely made it harder to estimate how many there were total

Just because we don't know who the other people are, doesn't mean it's fair to put one participant into a state of unequal power/choice, even if that was chosen randomly. This is not necessarily the fault of the choosing participant, as I am unsure what I would have done in their shoes. I believe the fairness of this lies in the researchers who designed the ""experimenter-blind"" task assignment procedure, not the participant.

<br>Player1-Overestimator: hi
<br>Player2-Underestimator: What were your guesses?
<br>Player3-Overestimator: 100
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I guess I'm an underestimator, I just tried to figure out how many there were based on the number on the top left
<br>Player1-Overestimator: i guess 80
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i said 50
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i had no idea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: It was so quick 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I could count 5 dots hahahah
<br>Player3-Overestimator: wait mine said im an overestimator
<br>Player1-Overestimator: so it's between 50-80
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i just looked at the big ones
<br>Player1-Overestimator: probably 60
<br>Player4-Underestimator: maybe i have no idea
<br>Player4-Underestimator: tbh
<br>Player2-Underestimator: so what do you think will happen next?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i doubted myself after the number margins were so big
<br>Player4-Underestimator: like we have
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i didnt even really see the dots tbh
<br>Player4-Underestimator: 50, 80, 100
<br>Player3-Overestimator: I have no idea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: what is the trick?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: wb the other underestimator?
<br>Player3-Overestimator: idk
<br>Player1-Overestimator: It's so quick
<br>Player3-Overestimator: are you in cimpian's class?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: nah
<br>Player4-Underestimator: van bavel
<br>Player2-Underestimator: do you think we will now do the opposite
<br>Player4-Underestimator: ?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: wdym
<br>Player2-Underestimator: overestimators will underestimate?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: oh maybe
<br>Player4-Underestimator: no idea
