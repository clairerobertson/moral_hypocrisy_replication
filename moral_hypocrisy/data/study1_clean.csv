<br>Player1-Overestimator: hi
<br>Player2-Underestimator: What were your guesses?
<br>Player3-Overestimator: 100
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I guess I'm an underestimator, I just tried to figure out how many there were based on the number on the top left
<br>Player1-Overestimator: i guess 80
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i said 50
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i had no idea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: It was so quick 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I could count 5 dots hahahah
<br>Player3-Overestimator: wait mine said im an overestimator
<br>Player1-Overestimator: so it's between 50-80
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i just looked at the big ones
<br>Player1-Overestimator: probably 60
<br>Player4-Underestimator: maybe i have no idea
<br>Player4-Underestimator: tbh
<br>Player2-Underestimator: so what do you think will happen next?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i doubted myself after the number margins were so big
<br>Player4-Underestimator: like we have
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i didnt even really see the dots tbh
<br>Player4-Underestimator: 50, 80, 100
<br>Player3-Overestimator: I have no idea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: what is the trick?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: wb the other underestimator?

<br>Player4-Underestimator: i said 50
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i had no idea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: It was so quick 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I could count 5 dots hahahah

<br>Player1-Overestimator: Well the true number lays between those two guesses
<br>Player2-Underestimator: im an underestimator and guessed 50
<br>Player2-Underestimator: so more than 50

<br>Player4-Underestimator: i wonder if i accidentally said 11 LMAO
<br>Player3-Overestimator: Probably by 50?
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I think maybe 50-70 dots
<br>Player4-Underestimator: probably
<br>Player3-Overestimator: I overestimated with 79

<br>Player1-Overestimator: so it's below 79
<br>Player4-Underestimator: it said we may have seen different images
<br>Player3-Overestimator: It felt like there was a lot more

<br>Player2-Underestimator: how do you tend to decide how to estimate--like what determines too big?
<br>Player3-Overestimator: Though the test shows that I'm an overestimator, I actually tend to leave too little time for a task :(
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I actually tend to overestimate 'situations' in general but I guess not every time
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I think our own perspective about the situation 
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I think I tend to underestimate numbers
<br>Player4-Underestimator: or like portions

<br>Player2-Underestimator: Hi！
<br>Player1-Overestimator: hey
<br>Player3-Overestimator: I think i overestimated because I thought there were around 10 big circles so I assumed there would be more than 30 circles
<br>Player1-Overestimator: You mean the one about estimate the dots?
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i feel like i just estimate oh it must be ""at least"" this amount and maybe that's why i underestimate things?

<br>Player4-Underestimator: Hi! How many dots did you all estimate?
<br>Player3-Overestimator: 50
<br>Player3-Overestimator: hhhhhh
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I thought I saw 150
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i said 25
<br>Player3-Overestimator: omg 150
<br>Player2-Underestimator: 75
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I know that was a lot compared to what was on the screen 
<br>Player1-Overestimator: but I said I rather have more than less
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i started to count and within seconds it was over
<br>Player3-Overestimator: yes

<br>Player3-Overestimator: we all have different image right?
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I believe so 
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i didnt say a very high number only because i thought it was a small area so it couldn't be
<br>Player3-Overestimator: I think my image is around 40 or some
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I had black dots on a white screen 
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i think we had similar images

<br>Player3-Overestimator: i was like 25 eh nvm ill choose 30
<br>Player2-Underestimator: i counted down the row and then across 
<br>Player4-Underestimator: yeah i was like 50
<br>Player4-Underestimator: no 45
<br>Player2-Underestimator: and multiplied
<br>Player1-Overestimator: it just looked like 40 to me honestly 
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i didnt do any math i just eyeball
<br>Player1-Overestimator: i didn't really see it for too long though

<br>Player3-Overestimator: hhhhhh
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I thought I saw 150
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i said 25
<br>Player3-Overestimator: omg 150
<br>Player2-Underestimator: 75
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I know that was a lot compared to what was on the screen 
<br>Player1-Overestimator: but I said I rather have more than less
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i started to count and within seconds it was over
<br>Player3-Overestimator: yes

<br>Player3-Overestimator: toooo fast
<br>Player2-Underestimator: Hmm seems hard to judge someone for being one or the other with only one test

<br>Player3-Overestimator: I think my image is around 40 or some
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I had black dots on a white screen 
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i think we had similar images
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I did too

<br>Player1-Overestimator: Hi!!
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I am an overestimator lol I think it is because of the big dots
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I always underestimate but i think my image having different sized circles made it hard  
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I am also a underestimator as I think the big dots take too much space
<br>Player2-Underestimator: yeah i counted them first and just uped it by 4 times

<br>Player3-Overestimator: what images did u guys have 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: i thought there would be about 100 dots
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i said 50
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I had a lot of different sizes of dots
<br>Player4-Underestimator: Random dots, big and small
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I also said 50
<br>Player3-Overestimator: ok same i think we all had that
<br>Player2-Underestimator: there were a mix of small and big dots in a a square form
<br>Player1-Overestimator: yeah same
<br>Player3-Overestimator: yup
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I got 65, but underestimated
<br>Player2-Underestimator: yeaaaa
<br>Player1-Overestimator: oh wow
<br>Player1-Overestimator: so does that mean there were more than 100 dots
<br>Player2-Underestimator: i guess soo
<br>Player3-Overestimator: thats so weird
<br>Player1-Overestimator: yeah it was definitely not 100
<br>Player2-Underestimator: what if it’s like 150
<br>Player1-Overestimator: i mean more than 100

<br>Player2-Underestimator: yea same for me

<br>Player1-Overestimator: I just have time to count the number of the biggest dots and no time to consider for the tiny ones
<br>Player4-Underestimator: Then got a image of a LOT of dots
<br>Player3-Overestimator: oh yes! I saw like more than 40 dots 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: i didnt get to count at all so I just kind of guessed
<br>Player4-Underestimator: Yea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: it was really a lot
<br>Player1-Overestimator: and the size varies a lot
<br>Player4-Underestimator: the image was shown for like 2 seconds

<br>Player3-Overestimator: Hello there
<br>Player2-Underestimator: Hi
<br>Player4-Underestimator: Hey :) I felt overwhelmed by how many dots there were! 
<br>Player1-Overestimator: Hi
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I just saw a lot of them
<br>Player3-Overestimator: Me too lol
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I tried to count the big ones first 
<br>Player1-Overestimator: Me too
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I wish we had more time
<br>Player3-Overestimator: I thought I would under-estimate them, and I turned out to be overestimating
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I tried to count how many there are in each row and then multiply 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: But the time is too short lol
<br>Player4-Underestimator: That's smart!
<br>Player1-Overestimator: I thought I had it right but I didn't
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I thought I was overestimating when I was underestimating 
<br>Player3-Overestimator: LOL
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I think the different sized dots made it especially hard to count and gauge the number
<br>Player2-Underestimator: Yes
<br>Player3-Overestimator: Definitely
