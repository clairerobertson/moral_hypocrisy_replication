Player2-Underestimator,3,2,7,10,I think it's experimenter-blind but the participant can choose the assignment themselves which can introduce other biases,Maybe how we would react when someone else made the decision we saw on video? After we interacted with everyone during the chat perhaps we might feel betrayed that the user picked the green task.,1,NA,2,"I believe the chat was real because we talked about real things like participation credits and things we had to do in school. (someone had to write an essay etc.). However, I don't believe the screen recording was real (it was probably pre-set). This is because we never got a warning about a screen recording at the beginning of the survey (I feel like we would've needed to install something to have our screen recorded and set that up beforehand).",I said picking the green task was super fair because they just want what's best for them and I would want the same for myself too haha!!,OK -- no issues," *** Player1-Overestimator has joined the chat ***

Player4-Underestimator,4,2,4,10,"I believe this fills the blind brief in that the researchers did not choose which participant did which experiment, however, I think that having the three other participants and I speak prior to choosing makes it less blind. I also believe that it is not necessarily fair as there isn't randomization. Just because we don't know who the other people are, doesn't mean it's fair to put one participant into a state of unequal power/choice, even if that was chosen randomly. This is not necessarily the fault of the choosing participant, as I am unsure what I would have done in their shoes. I believe the fairness of this lies in the researchers who designed the ""experimenter-blind"" task assignment procedure, not the participant. I also think that almost everyone will choose the green task as it is stated as taking a shorter amount of time.","I think the purpose was to demonstrate the likelihood that when given the opportunity to fill the role of someone with power, we are incredibly likely to take that role and fill it.",1,NA,2,"I am naturally sceptical and as our titles in the chat showed, we were either not honest with each other or not assigned groups based on our accuracy. This was my first assumption of lack honesty on behalf of the researcher/experiment. It also seemed to me that as we were purposefully allowed to speak to each other and foster a connection (albeit a very small one), there may have been the intention to ""pit"" us against each other or at least elicit an emotional response in regard to the question of fairness.",This is unlike other studies I've done and I actually rather enjoyed it,OK -- no issues," *** Player1-Overestimator has joined the chat ***

<br>Player3-Overestimator: 100
<br>Player4-Underestimator: I guess I'm an underestimator, I just tried to figure out how many there were based on the number on the top left
<br>Player1-Overestimator: i guess 80
<br>Player4-Underestimator: i said 50
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i had no idea
<br>Player2-Underestimator: It was so quick 
<br>Player2-Underestimator: I could count 5 dots hahahah
<br>Player3-Overestimator: wait mine said im an overestimator
<br>Player1-Overestimator: so it's between 50-80
<br>Player3-Overestimator: i just looked at the big ones
<br>Player1-Overestimator: probably 60
<br>Player4-Underestimator: maybe i have no idea
